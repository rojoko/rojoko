I am a passionate builder. Currently I am Venture CTO / Engineering Lead at BCG Digital Ventures with a demonstrated history as CTO in the startup and corporate venturing ecosystem, bridging deep technology know-how and strategic management. I led 10+ startups, corporate ventures, and enterprise projects as both technical and strategic leader. 

Having worked in the software industry since 15+ years I have build products and teams in all venture stages from ideation and validation to incubation and scale-up, thereby switching seamlessly between product, consultancy and technology leadership roles. 

In product build, I live agile approaches and lean startup methodology with a strong focus on customer centricity, evolutionary design, team balance and continuous improvement. 

In recent years, I have been working with early stage corporate startups in interim CTO and technology leadership roles - building teams and coaching them to develop solid, scalable and secure cloud software products using technologies including:

* Languages: Ruby, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript and whatever solves the problem best
* Frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Spring Boot, React, Flutter
* Cloud Stacks: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform
* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis
* Message Brokers: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka
